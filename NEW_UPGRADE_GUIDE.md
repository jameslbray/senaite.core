**Python 3 and Plone 5 Compatibility**

SENAITE is a complex Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). Modernizing the project to support Python 3 and Plone 5 requires a phased approach to ensure stability and maintainability. This guide outlines a structured plan for the upgrade.

1. **Assessment and Planning**
    
    **1.1. Code Audit**
    
    - Conduct a comprehensive audit of the codebase to identify:
        - Python 2-specific constructs (e.g., print statements, unicode handling, old-style classes).
        - Dependencies specific to Plone 4 and Archetypes.
        - Areas of tight coupling between the codebase and deprecated features of Python 2 or Plone 4.
    
    **Tools to Use:**
    
    - [pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/) with Python 3 plugins for compatibility checks.
    - [caniusepython3](https://pypi.org/project/caniusepython3/) to identify dependencies blocking Python 3 support.
    - Custom scripts to scan for Archetypes usage and old API patterns.
    
    **1.2. Dependency Review**
    
    - Create a dependency list and document the compatibility status for each library.
    - Check if older libraries (e.g., Plone add-ons) have updated versions or alternatives.

**Steps:**

1. Audit dependencies using pip list and dependency tools.
2. For unmaintained libraries, assess replacement options or plan to fork and modernize them.
3. Document compatibility for:
    - Plone 5 ecosystem libraries.
    - Python 3-compatible versions of Plone add-ons and utilities.
1. **Preparation**
    
    **2.1. Freeze the Existing Codebase**
    
    - Create a maintenance branch for ongoing bug fixes and support in the legacy Python 2/Plone 4 environment.
    
    **2.2. Set Up Development Environments**
    
    - Establish separate environments for Python 3/Plone 5 migration:
    - Use venv or tools like Docker to isolate the development environment.
    - Install Plone 5 in a clean environment for testing.
    
    **2.3. Continuous Integration (CI) Setup**
    
    - Configure CI pipelines to test the codebase in both environments:
        - Python 2.7 and Plone 4.
        - Python 3.9+ and Plone 5.
    - Recommended tools: **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI/CD**, or **Jenkins**.
2. **Python 2 to Python 3 Migration**
    
    **3.1. Recommended Approach**
    
    - Avoid heavy reliance on six for long-term maintainability. Instead:
        - Use **modernization-first** tools like 2to3 to perform initial changes.
        - Gradually refactor Python 2-specific constructs into Python 3.
    
    **Steps:**
    
    1. Add __future__ imports to ease transitions:

```python
	from __future__ import print_function, division, unicode_literals 
```

1. Replace Python 2 idioms with Python 3 equivalents:
    - Replace xrange with range.
    - Use list(dict.keys()) instead of dict.keys().
    - Handle string and byte conversions explicitly using str and bytes.
    - Use f-strings for improved readability (Python 3.6+).
    - Remove obsolete Python 2 imports like StringIO.
    
    **Testing:**
    
    - Test with tools like tox to verify compatibility across Python versions.
    - Use pytest and ensure existing test cases pass under Python 3.

**3.2. Handling Legacy Constructs**

- Replace __metaclass__ with Python 3 class-based syntax.
- Refactor deprecated exception handling (e.g., except Exception, e to except Exception as e).
- Update file handling to use the with open(...) syntax.

**3.3. Library Updates**

- Upgrade libraries to Python 3-compatible versions or find alternatives.
- Replace deprecated libraries (e.g., urllib2 with urllib.request).
1. **Plone 4 to Plone 5 Migration**
    
    **4.1. Content Type Migration: Dexterity vs Archetypes**
    
    **Recommendation**: Transition to **Dexterity** content types for the following reasons:
    
    - Dexterity is the default in Plone 5 and beyond.
    - It provides better customization and extensibility.
    - Migration tools like [collective.transmogrifier](https://github.com/collective/collective.transmogrifier) can assist in converting content from Archetypes.
    
    **Migration Process:**
    
    1.  Audit current Archetypes content types.
    2. Use collective.transmogrifier to map and migrate data.
    3. Refactor custom logic to align with Dexterity schema and views.
    
    **4.2. UI and Template Updates**
    
    - Update templates to use Plone 5’s barceloneta theme.
    - Refactor views to leverage Plone 5’s modernized UI components.
    - Replace deprecated Plone 4 patterns with Plone 5 standards.
    
    **4.3. Workflow and Permissions**
    
    - Review existing workflows and update them to align with Plone 5’s enhanced workflow engine.

**4.4. Registry and Configuration Updates**

- Replace XML configurations with Plone 5’s registry-based system.
- Use Plone’s plone.registry to manage configuration changes.
1. **Phased Rollout**
    
    **5.1. Phase 1: Python 3 Compatibility**
    
    - Focus first on achieving Python 3 compatibility while maintaining Plone 4 support.
    - Test exhaustively with dual-environment CI pipelines.
    - Once stable, drop Python 2 support and remove compatibility workarounds.
    
    **5.2. Phase 2: Full Plone 5 Migration**
    
    - Transition the main branch to Plone 5 and drop Plone 4 support.
    - Migrate all content types to Dexterity.
2. **Testing and Validation**
    
    **6.1. Unit Tests**
    
    - Extend unit test coverage to include all critical functionality.
    - Use pytest-cov to measure test coverage and identify gaps.
    
    **6.2. Functional and Integration Tests**
    
    - Automate end-to-end testing with tools like **Selenium** or **Robot Framework**.
    - Validate UI workflows and backend integrations.
    
    **6.3. Performance Testing**
    
    - Benchmark key operations to compare performance under Python 2/Plone 4 and Python 3/Plone 5.
3. **Documentation and Training**
    
    **7.1. Update Documentation**
    
    - Update developer documentation to reflect Python 3 and Plone 5 changes.
    - Revise user guides to accommodate Dexterity content types and new UI workflows.
    
    **7.2. Provide Training**
    
    - Train developers on Python 3 best practices and Plone 5 features.
    - Create video tutorials or webinars for end users.
4. **Release Strategy**
    
    **8.1. Beta Release**
    
    - Release beta versions for community feedback.
    - Address bugs and issues reported by users.
    
    **8.2. Stable Release**
    
    - After thorough testing, release a stable version and document the upgrade process for users.
5. **Long-Term Maintenance**
- Establish processes for regular updates to keep pace with Python and Plone improvements.
- Prioritize modular, maintainable code to simplify future upgrades.
